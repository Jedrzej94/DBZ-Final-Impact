# Dragon Ball Z: Final Impact (0.3z R2-2)
________________________
It is a program that I have developed not so long ago. Its main purpose was to create an immersive 3D world of Dragon Ball and let all the players enjoy the game together and have fun.

**NOTE:**
Please keep in mind, that some of documentation in the main code is written in my native language. It is an old habit that I used to have. All my latest works are always in English language only.

PAWN, MySQL (non-threaded version) are used in the main PWN file. C++ languages were used to create DLL plugins.

# Further progress
________________________
Code is based on San Andreas MAP. Project was supposed to be developed further on Unity3D game engine.

# Skills needed
________________________
In order to develop this project, it will require from you certain skills such as:

* Modelling in 3Ds Max Studio (or any other 3D Modelling program).
* Texturizing, which means ability to use graphical program like GIMP or Adobe Photoshop.
* Programming in PAWN/C++ and other languages I have mentioned in the caption (unless you want to move it onto Unity3D or any other game engine).
* Animating characters/models (can be done with 3Ds Max Studio).

And of course logical thinking is very necessary, your time and efford. Creating game is taking a very long time, which is why I have decided to stop development of this project on my own.

# Source
________________________
I am including all the source files where necessary. In order to create installer again, you will need a Install Creator Pro software; or you can simply create your own one using InstallShield or anything like that.

* Models do not need any source files, since they can be opened through 3Ds Max Studio. Just open a converted file already (*.dff) in a software.

* Audio files are including source and can be edited through Sony Vegas (main source file) or through any other audio program. I have used SV 13.

* Animations were made by me from scratch, you can edit them through 3Ds Max Studio as well if it's necessary for you.

Feel free to edit everything as you wish, please keep in file(s) its main developer. All the sound effects were made by me from scratch, I have spent some quality time doing this project and I am not willing to continue it anymore, so please contact me if you have any issues developing this project any further. 

I will be happy to assist you. Thanks!
