# Dragon Ball Z: Final Impact (0.3z R2-2)
________________________
It is a program that I have developed not so long ago. Its main purpose was to create an immersive 3D world of Dragon Ball and let all the players enjoy the game together and have fun.

**NOTE:**
Please keep in mind, that some of documentation in the main code is written in my native language. It is an old habit that I used to have. All my latest works are always in English language only.

PAWN, MySQL (non-threaded version) are used in the main PWN file. C++ languages were used to create DLL plugins.

# Source
________________________
I am including all the source files where necessary. In order to create installed again, you will need a Install Creator Pro software; or you can simply create one using InstallShield or anything like that.

* Models do not need any source files, since they can be opened through 3Ds Max Studio. Just open a converted file already (*.dff) in a software.

* Audio files are including source and can be edited through Sony Vegas (main source file) or through any other audio program. I have used SV 13.

* Animations were made by me from scratch, you can edit them through 3Ds Max Studio as well if it's necessary for you.
